/**
 * MedStock Design System — ServRx-aligned (2026).
 *
 * Bright clinical teal as the single confident brand colour, cobalt blue as the
 * secondary accent, on clean cool-white surfaces (never warm/greige). Friendly
 * rounded headings (Poppins) + highly legible data type (Inter). Modelled on the
 * ServRx pharmacy portal: colour-coded KPI cards, tinted summary bars, teal tab
 * underlines and active states, soft shadows over hairline borders.
 *
 * Token *structure* is unchanged from the previous system, so every screen and
 * the shared/ui kit re-skin from these values alone.
